Hedwig Queue Consumer App Terraform module
==========================================

[Hedwig](https://github.com/Automatic/hedwig) is a inter-service communication bus that works on Google Pub/Sub, while keeping things pretty simple and
straight forward. It uses [json schema](http://json-schema.org/) draft v4 for schema validation so all incoming
and outgoing messages are validated against pre-defined schema.

This module provides a custom [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) modules for deploying Hedwig infrastructure that
creates infra for Hedwig consumer app.

## Usage 

```hcl
module "consumer-dev-myapp" {
  source   = "standard-ai/hedwig-queue/google"
  queue    = "dev-myapp"
  alerting = true

  labels = {
    app     = "myapp"
    env     = "dev"
  }
}
```

It's recommended that `queue` include your environment. 

Naming convention - lowercase alphanumeric and dashes only.

Please note Google's restrictions (if not followed, errors may be confusing and often totally wrong):
- [Labels](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels#requirements)
- [Resource names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/admin#resource_names) 

The Google queue and subscription names will be prefixed by `hedwig-`.

## Caveats

Google limits the [lifecycle](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber#lifecycle) of a subscription. By default, if a subscription
has not received any messages in 31 days, it'll be deleted. Terraform currently [does not support](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/2507) 
overriding this behavior.
